                    <p>Hi voter, I am Yulia, 4th year Computing student who loves Imperial and wants to make it an even better place!</p>

                    <p>I have been volunteering for the union through out my degree. I have been a year rep for JMC and Computing, represented engineering students at union council. I have been actively involved with my departamental society (DoCSoc) first as events officer, significantly increasing the number of events, students participation and engagement with the society, then as a chair doubling the societies sponsorship and further increasing the students' involvement with the society. In my free time I have been a member of the university cheerleading team and taught kids to program. </p>

                    <p>I absolutely loved to be able to improve Computing students' time here at Imperial and I would really like to dedicate a year of my life to making your university experience even better. </p>

                    <p><strong>What I want to improve:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Welfare.</strong> I want this year to focus on welfare and especially stress and depression problems at our university more than any other year before it. I want to achieve better welfare representation across all departments and work together with the College to improve the personal tutor support students are getting. I believe that every week should be a stress relief week and you don't need to have signed up for the right mailing list to hear about all the welfare events going on around campus.</p>

                    <p><strong>Innovation.</strong> More recogniton from the university for the side projects, I will campaign for the university to give more recognition for the extracutticular projects students are dedicating a large proportion of their time to. I also want to improve the engagement between the departments to give more students the opportunity to work on cross-departamental projects as I think this way we will see even more innovative products being produced by Imperial College students. </p>

                    <p><strong>A union that works for you.</strong> Easier way to handle clubs and societies transactions! Having a technology background myself, I believe the e-activities should be far easier to use, we should have an online payment option for sponsors and donors. We should have a better way to see what events are going on campus by utilising facebook feeds. I would happily volunteer my Computing skills and put extra hours towards making the union technology even better. I would love to attract more students to volunteer their programming skills to improve union's technology as it could be a great opportunity for students who are looking for a side project but don't have an idea of what to build.</p>

                    <p><strong>Equal representation.</strong> Increase the representation of postgraduate and business school students at the union. I feel like this category of students especially those that are here only for a year don't get the best out of their time here ..</p>

                    <p>Most importantly I will be open to hear your critisism and ideas on how to make the union the better place. I believe that being a president of the union is not an individual job but it is about collaborating with students, listening to their suggestions and feedback. I want to work together with the students of this university to make this place ideal for their needs.</p>
